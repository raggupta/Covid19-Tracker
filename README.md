# Covid19-Tracker
 Java XML API Web API Covid19 Tracker has developed its own CoronaVirus tracker that allows users to self-report symptoms, if they test positive for the virus, alert contacts so that they can seek medical care to prevent spread. The first infection with 2019-nCoV in the United States was reported on January 21, 2020. The WHO has now documented more than 50 confirmed Cases of CoronaVirus in the United States. We continue to report the latest WHO data indicated by the following Criteria: WHO confirmed Infections are shown in RED, WHO deaths are shown in BLACK. User can self-report and they are divided into three categories: Users that have NOT tested positive for the virus and are asymptomatic are shown as DARK GREEN Users that have NOT tested Positive for the virus but have symptoms such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath are shown as YELLOW Users who Self Report that they have tested Positive for the CoronaVirus are shown as PINK Users can update their Information as symptoms change and these changes are reflected on the Map.
